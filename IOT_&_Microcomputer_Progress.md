## Raspbian pi use in Industry AS:- 

- Media centers
- File Servers 
- Retro Game console
- Routers
- Network level ad_blockers etc....

## Main components consist a Raspbian pi 4 Board
- Processor ( BCM2711 SOC with 64bit, Quad core ARM cortex-A72 CPU at 1.5GHz)
- 1,2 or 4 Gb LPDDR4 RAM
- wifi and bluetooth 5.0
- MIPI camera and display connectors
- Gigabite ethernet
- 2x USB 2.0 and 2x USB 3.0
- 3.5mm audio and composite video
- USB type C power connector (5V, 3+ A)
- Dual Micro HDMI sockets
- Hardware decoding of H.264@ H.265 1080 & 4k video upto 60fps
- 40-pin GPIO(General purpose input/output) and 4-pin POE(power over ethernet)

We study about raspberry pi system from different source like youtube and https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/ ( documentation 
about accessories and functionality of raspberry pi system)

We go through all documentation and learn connectivity of raspberry board with different output and input devices. Also learn the process of embedding
OS on raspberry board using a SD card.

then we go through software part of raspberry board as like 
- how to setup workbench
- which type of platform required to run our algorithm
- How data will be processed
- how much optimum fps it can give
- How to remotely access our raspberry system
- How different sensors can we connect with raspberry pi system
